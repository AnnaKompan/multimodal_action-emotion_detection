Compare classical CNN on raw images vs. MLP on keypoints extracted via MP Holistic (preprocess)
to demonstrate frugal learning: 
- reduced computational cost
- faster training
- similar or acceptable accuracy

Compare both by:
- training time
- GPU usage
- model size (MB)
- inference time per frame as metrics

AffectNet dataset rather then FER 2013, cuz RGB images, higher resolution
~1,000,000
